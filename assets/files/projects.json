				"The Code Crafters project aims to use the generation of quilts as a vehicle to teach computer science to users who are familiar with traditional crafts but not programming. To fulfill that goal, workshops are to be run with software that generates quilt designs based on half-square triangles. Participants will learn how the program works and how to modify the generator / generated quilts to fit their visions.",
				"The first prototype generator for the project was an evolution-based generator written in Java using <a href=\"https://processing.org\" class=\"hoverLink\" style=\"color:#42484F;\"><u>Processing</u></a>. This prototype randomly generates a number of quilts according to several base parameters. For as many generations as the user specified, the generator selects some number of \"best\" quilts from that generation according to user - specified fitness functions. Upon reaching the final generation, the user is able to sift through each of the generated quilts from that generation and view the RGB, Hexadecimal, and HSV values for each triangle in the quilt.",
				"The second and current prototype generator for the project is a live editor written in JavaScript using <a href=\"https://p5js.org\" class=\"hoverLink\" style=\"color:#42484F;\"><u>p5.js</u></a>. This prototype allows the user to upload a text representation of a base quilt to begin editing or to define a quilt entirely in the text fields of the editor. The structure of the editor is built around the idea of user manipulation of the plaintext quilt data. Fabric colors for the quilt are declared before the main body of data and represented with single characters in order to introduce the concept of variables while doing so in a way that many experienced quilters may already be experienced with.",
