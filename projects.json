For as many generations as the user specified, the generator selects some number of \"best\" quilts from that generation according to user - specified fitness functions. Upon reaching the final generation, the user is able to sift through each of the generated quilts from that generation and view the RGB, Hexadecimal, and HSV values for each triangle in the quilt.",

The structure of the editor is built around the idea of user manipulation of the plaintext quilt data. Fabric colors for the quilt are declared before the main body of data and represented with single characters in order to introduce the concept of variables while doing so in a way that many experienced quilters may already be experienced with.",
